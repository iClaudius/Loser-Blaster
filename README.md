a 2-D game built using the Gosu library available for ruby. Play as Trump, blast 'losers'. 

Hey Loser Blasters. A more comprehensive README will come soon. For now, here's a simple step-by-step guide to install the Gosu library and get the game up and running. 

Happy blasting and Godspeed. 


#### How to install and run

1. Fork and clone the repository

2. Download the Gosu library
    - For OSX: https://github.com/gosu/gosu/wiki/getting-started-on-os-x
    - For Windows: https://github.com/gosu/gosu/wiki/Getting-Started-on-Windows
   
3. Navigate into your forked forked repository and in the command line type: 
    > ruby loser_blaster_scenes.rb
    
    

If everything is working properly your game should begin! 

_note: there's still a lot of work to be done with this game, but have fun goofing off for now_


#### How to Play

Fly around space and try not to get hit by all the losers flying around. 

Use the left and right arrow keys to point our Commander and Cheif's head in the direction you want to fly, the forward arrow to move, and the space bar to shoot 'Art of the Deal' out Donald's face and blast losers.
